/**
 * @brief This class should be attached to a robot and publish its states.
 * It is responsibility of the owning robot to update the structs, this way the class can be kept more flexible and work with robots
 * defined by multiple actors as well as robots defined by a skeletal mesh. This could use a refactor once the robots are more well
 * defined and could require a refactor of the main publisher class as well, to avoid the iterator Idx as it is used now Ideally, it
 * should be this class that fetches all the necessary data to be published.
 * @todo Implementation should follow the other publisher classes.
